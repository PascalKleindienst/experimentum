üë®‚Äçüî¨üî¨Experimentum is a domain-independent data-management framework for running and analyzing computational experiments.

## About Experimentum

![Experimentum Dashboard](https://pascalkleindienst.github.io/experimentum/_images/dashboard.png)
*Fig. 1: Web-Interface Dashboard*

The main purposes of Experimentum are to support experimenters in conducting routine tasks in complex experiments more efficiently. Experimentum itself takes care of the database-specific parts of the data management: creating and modifying the database schema, storing the  collected experiment results, and retrieving data from the database for further analysis.

### Features
- Domain-independent
- Independent of used database *(standard is a SQL database, but implementation can be swapped out to support NoSQL databases like MongoDB)*
- Migrations and Schema-builder to easily create the database-schema *(no need to know SQL!)*
- Visualize results with matplotlib
- Manage Experiments via CLI or via Web-Interface


## Installation üë®‚Äçüíª
The framework can be easily installed via `pip` with the following command:

`$ pip install experimentum`

>The different ``dbapi`` packages are not part of the package dependencies, so you must install them in order to connect to corresponding databases:
>* PostgreSQL: ``psycopg2``
>* MySQL: ``PyMySQL`` or ``mysqlclient``
>* Oracle: ``cx_oracle``
>* Microsoft SQL Server: ``pyodbc`` or ``pymssql``
>* SQLite: The ``sqlite3`` module is bundled with Python by default

### Getting Started
In order to use the experimentum framework, you‚Äôll have to take care of some initial setup. You‚Äôll need to auto-generate some code that creates the config files, migrations, repositories and other application-specific settings.

From the command line, `cd` into a directory where you would like to store your code, and then run the following command:

~~~
$ experimentum-quickstart
# if you you want to create the project in a subdirectory you can add the --root option
# experimentum-quickstart --root myproject
~~~

This willl create a **myproject** directory in your current directoy. The quickstart command will have created the following:
```
/
    config/
        app.json
        storage.json
    experiments/
        __init__.py
    logs/
    migrations/
        {TIMESTAMP}_create_experiments.py
        {TIMESTAMP}_create_testcase.py
        {TIMESTAMP}_create_performance.py
    repositories/
        __init__.py
        ExperimentRepository.py
        PerformanceRepository.py
        TestcaseRepository.py
    main.py
```
These files are:

- **main.py**: The main entry point of the framework. It lets you interact with the experimentum framework via the command line.
- **config/**: Contains all configuration files. You can place you own configuration files here. All *.json files will be loaded by the framework and available via the Config class under the config attribute of the App class.
- **config/app.json** and **storage.json**: Framework related settings. For more information see Configuration
- **experiments/**: Here you can place your experiments and their configrations.
- **logs/**: Contains the log files.
- **migrations/**: Your migration files are placed here.
- **migrations/{TIMESTAMP}_create_experiments.py**: Migration for creating the experiments table.
- **migrations/{TIMESTAMP}_create_testcase.py**: Migration for creating the testcase table.
- **migrations/{TIMESTAMP}_create_performance.py**: Migration for creating the performance table.
- **repositories/ExperimentRepository.py**: Repository for experiment data.
- **repositories/TestcaseRepository.py**: Repository for testcase data.
- **repositories/PerformanceRepository.py**: Repository for performance data.
